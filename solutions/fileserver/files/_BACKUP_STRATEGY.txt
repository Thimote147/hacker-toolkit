                    BACKUP STRATEGY DOCUMENTATION
                         INTERNAL USE ONLY
================================================================================

DATE: October 15, 2003
DEPARTMENT: IT Infrastructure & Security
CLASSIFICATION: CONFIDENTIAL

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CURRENT BACKUP ENCRYPTION STATUS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION:
  Our backup files are currently encrypted using a 4-digit PIN protection
  mechanism. This method has been in place since 1998 and has served our
  needs adequately for legacy systems.

  Current encryption: 4-digit numeric PIN (1000-9999 range)

SECURITY ASSESSMENT:
  Recent internal security audits have identified that 4-digit PIN protection
  is no longer sufficient for protecting sensitive corporate data against
  modern brute-force attacks. The IT Security team has recommended immediate
  upgrade to industry-standard encryption methods.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WORK IN PROGRESS - ENCRYPTION MIGRATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STATUS: ***ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT - Q4 2003***

NEW ENCRYPTION STANDARD:
  Migration to AES-256 encryption with strong cryptographic keys
  - Minimum 32-character alphanumeric passwords
  - Support for special characters and extended key length
  - Implementation of key rotation policies
  - Secure key management system integration

TIMELINE:
  Phase 1 (Nov 2003): Pilot testing with non-critical data
  Phase 2 (Dec 2003): Infrastructure upgrades and key vault deployment
  Phase 3 (Jan 2004): Full production rollout
  Phase 4 (Feb 2004): Deprecation of legacy 4-digit PIN system

MIGRATION NOTES:
  - All existing 4-digit PIN encrypted backups will remain accessible during
    transition period
  - Legacy backup files will be re-encrypted with new system upon access
  - Training sessions scheduled for IT staff in November
  - Backup restore procedures being updated in documentation

RESPONSIBLE PARTIES:
  Project Lead: Sarah Mitchell 
  Security Team: security-admin@web2000-corp.com
  Infrastructure: Henry Jenkins

TEMPORARY NOTICE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: During this transition period, backup files may exist with both
old (4-digit PIN) and new (strong key) encryption methods. Please verify
with the IT helpdesk before attempting to restore any backup files.
